## Winning<a name="winning"></a>

Winner: tally VP  
Tie: all win  

**End Game** is triggered at the end of the last turn of the **event deck**, or at the end of a turn where no warm or cold cards remain in either row.  

**Extinction** occurs when any player has only daughter cubes remaining. That player is eliminated.

### Generating VP

Note: Polytheism and Monotheism generate points differently.

_Population_:    

* 1 VP per cube or cylinder not in Valhalla  
* 2 VP per cube on cold side New Worlds (otherwise as above).

_Trophy (Polytheism)_:

* Card's in your tableau with a trophy icon list their VP value.

_Resources (Monotheism)_:

* 1 VP per Ivory
* 2 VP per Iron
* Cards in your tableau with either resource value are converted into those points for end game scoring.

_Representative (Monotheism)_:

* 4 VP per (opponent) placard where you have a **representative** cube.

  * Make hunt rolls on biomes in order of first player's choice.
1. Domestic Animals
  * Any player on a hostile New World can pay 1 ivory to pacify (flip) it.
