Easy and very mild[^1] curry.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 pack of Japanese Curry Roux
* 1/4 cup of sake
* 1 Tbsp soy sauce
* 1 Tbsp mirin
* 1 cup of chicken stock
* 1 cup of water
* 500g chicken thighs
* 4 cloves of garlic
* 2 onions large
* 1 carrot large
* 2 potatoes large
* Peas
* Olive oil
* White pepper


## Preparation

* Roughly chop potatoes, carrot, garlic, and onion
* Chop chicken into chunks (e.g. 3cm)
* Heat stock

## Cooking

* Add to a pot of boiling water the potatoes and carrot, and boil for 20 mins
* Add a splash of olive oil to wok and cook the garlic and onion until onion is softening.
* Turn up the heat and add chicken, and a pinch of pepper, to the wok and cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is browning.
* Add stock, water, and sake to the wok and let boil for a minute, then reduce heat to a simmer.
* Strain potatoes and carrot and add to the wok. Simmer for 15 minutes.
* Ladle the roux into the wok allowing it to dissolve.
* Add the mirin, soy sauce, and peas, mix and simmer for 3 minutes.

Serve on rice. 

## Note

[^1]: Japanese curry is quite mild so even a roux pack labelled hot will, compared to indian or thai curries, be much milder.
 
* Add additional water to the wok when adding the peas if the curry needs a little thinning. The curry however should still be quite thick.
